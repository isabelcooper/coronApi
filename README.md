# coronApi

OpenSource project 

The project is split into an API and separate UI (currently undeveloped)
A run script on the main repo allows: 

`./version_check` - checks your current node version to confirm if a change is needed 

`./test` - runs all tests locally. NB this also changes to the correct version of node if you have it and installs all packages before starting.

`./test-api` - like ./test, but just runs the api tests

`./test-ui` - like ./test, but just runs the ui tests

`./start-api` - starts the API server locally* 

`./start-ui` - starts the UI server locally
